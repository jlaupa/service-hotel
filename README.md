4) Then execute ``` make php ``` and then you will be taken into php docker.
5) Execute ``` composer install ```
6) Copy .env.example to .env and replace the fields if necessary.
7) Go inside src folder (please, go inside don't run the command above from outside this folder)
8) Execute ``` php yii migrate ``` to create tables // pwd : /var/www/html/src
9) If they not exist, create ```runtime``` and ```web/assets``` directories inside ```src``` folder.
10) Execute ``` chmod -R 777 runtime && chmod -R 777 web/assets```

### Tests
We have Unit, Integration & Api test. All your work must be tested before send the Pull Request.

Test setup:

* Go to your database and create a new one called ```thn_test```
* Go to the config folder copy ```test_params.example.php``` to ```test_params.php```
* Inside the docker container run from root ```cd src/tests/bin && php yii migrate```


Run test (go inside the docker and run it from root):
```
1.- docker exec -it php-api-container bash OR make php
2.- php vendor/bin/codecept run // for all (unit, integration, api)
```
or
```
composer test-u // for unit tersting
composer test-i // for integration tersting
composer test-a // for api tersting
```

Run:
